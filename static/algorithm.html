                        The item pool is one of the key concept behind the optimization of the FFBE Equip builder. It is able, given a goal, unit and monster specifications and a list of items, to only keep the best items, in order to drastically reduce the number of builds to try out. Conditional items are kept out :

                        It first use a complex comparison algorithm to determine the relation between the items, relative to the goal. Basically, it identifies which items are strictly better/worse than others. By "strictly worse", I mean : "this item can't be better than this other, in ALL cases, for this goal"

                        When all items are sorted out, given the number of time item of this type can be used in a build, it will cull all items that have NO chance of being BiS, that is, items that have N or more strictly better items, where N is the maximum number of slot of a type that can appear in a build (2 for weapon and accessories, 1 for shields, head/body gears, 4 for materia)

                        The kept items are the only one that will be considered when building. In the above case, if the user had 2x Marshal Glove, then Florid Hairpin wouldn't have been kept because there would have been 2 items strictly better, the two Marschal Gloves
